    <h1>PTIK FKIP UNS</h1>

    <p id="paragraf-ptik">
        The Faculty of Teacher Training and Education, Sebelas Maret University, Surakarta
        is an Educational Personnel Education Institution (LPTK) which has 24 study
        programs in 6 majors. Each study program has its own characteristics in producing
        superior, strong and intelligent educational staff. The Informatics and Computer Technology Education (PTIK) study program is
        planned to take shelter in the management of the Engineering and Vocational
        Education (PTK) department. This placement revises our previous statement, where
        the PTIK study program is under the P.MIPA department. PTIK is a study program
        that will produce graduates who are prioritized to teach in vocational/vocational
        programs. So, it would be better if PTIK was under the PTK department which
        oversees vocational programs such as Building Engineering Education, and
        Mechanical Engineering Education. To meet the needs of lecturers in the field of
        information technology that cannot be met by the PTK department, PTIK will
        conduct resource sharing with the mathematics study program.
